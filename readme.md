# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of the project is to refactor code - debugging and cleaning up the source code and CSS stylesheet provided to me, the developer, for Horiseon, a marketing company. Horiseon wants their code refactored in order to make their website more accesible for all users. Code that is compatible with accessibility devices increases the company's rank in search engines and helps the company avoid litigation if people with a disability would be unable to use their application. To complete the project, I used GitHub, creating a repository to store, push, pull, and deploy my work. I also used Visual Studio Code to edit the source-code and stylesheet. The most challenging component of the project was learning how to combine similar selectors in the CSS stylesheet. Combining the selectors and/or classes that shared identical rules allows for easier viewing and implementation of the styling. Through the work, I also dove deeper into semantic HTML order, learning more of the basics of ordering the elements, i.e. when to use main, aside, section, etc. This project reiterated the importance of making sure any application I work on in the future be accessible. In the future, I would like to learn more ways to increase the accessibility of applications.
